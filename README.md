Malbec BroadCast, a common/open-use brand for Open Source Software in Media
Broadcasting.

We are a lot of people trying to push for Free/Open Source Software in
Media. We have a lot of backgrounds, work for a lot of organizations, and
create a lot of products. That makes it hard:

* for us to find each other, leading to duplicated efforts.
* for our clients, that think that we compete when we really collaborate.

The G+ 'Open Broadcast' group started by Dan Dennedy (of MLT fame) is a
really good first step:

it helps us find each other.

But we need to take the next step for our clients, we hereby propose this
brand 'Malbec' (a really delicious Argentinian grape variety), as an
unifying identity.
